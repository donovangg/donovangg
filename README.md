# Hi I'm Donovan!

- I'm a webdev in sunny Los Angeles trying to build cool things. <br>
- I use primarily use Javascript to attempt to make those cool things. <br>
- [Astro](https://astro.build/) has piqued my interest. I built my [portfolio](https://donovangomez.com/) with it and had a lot of fun.
- I'm available for hire.
